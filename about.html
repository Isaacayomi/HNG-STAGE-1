        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a frontend developer passionate about crafting delightful,
          responsive user interfaces. I specialize in turning ideas into
          interactive and visually appealing web applications.

        <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal is to deepen my frontend development skills and become
          more confident in building scalable, accessible, and production-ready
          web applications. I also want to collaborate more with other
          developers, improve my problem-solving skills, and learn to think
          beyond just writing code, to building solutions that make impact.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I’m strengthening my grasp of design systems and responsive layout
          techniques, while also improving how I communicate my approach in
          collaborative environments.

        <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          You’ve come so far, even when it didn’t feel like progress. Every
          challenge taught you patience. Every project showed you what’s
          possible. Keep trusting the process, even when it’s quiet. Growth is
          happening, not in leaps, but in the quiet moments you keep showing up.

      <section class="about__section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I’m genuinely excited about the journey ahead. Beyond coding, I hope
          to keep building meaningful connections in tech communities, learn
          from people smarter than me, and eventually give back by helping
          beginners just like I once was.
